# Source code

Catalog of Go source under `cmd/` and `internal/`. Module path: `vrg`.

## cmd/

- `cmd/vrg/main.go` — thin process boundary. `run` calls `cli.Parse` with
  `os.Stat` injected and maps the explicit result kind to stream/status:
  help → exit 0 (help already on stdout), search → `runSearch` (Issue #3:
  starts ripgrep with the protected child argv, runs the Bubble Tea
  program, propagates exit codes), usage error → sanitized diagnostic on
  stderr, exit 2. See [search-collection-path](search-collection-path.md).

## internal/cli

- `internal/cli/cli.go` — the Issue #1 CLI foundation, the Issue #2
  search-flag allow-list and child-argv contract, and the sole `mow.cli`
  v1.2.0 adapter. Contains the shared `optionDecls`/`argDecls` table
  (parser config + raw-token recognition + generated help), the ordered
  `scanArgs`/`scanOption` preflight with ordered flag records and the
  cumulative `-u` count, `renderHelp`, `checkRoot`, the `Escape`
  sanitizer, and the `Result`/`Kind`/`ErrorKind`/`Env` contract.
  See [cli-foundation.md](cli-foundation.md) and
  [cli-flag-forwarding.md](cli-flag-forwarding.md).

## internal/searchindex

- `internal/searchindex/searchindex.go` — Issue #3: parses ripgrep
  `--json` stream events (`begin`, `match`, `end`, `summary`,
  `context`) into a navigable `Index` of `Stop` entries. Supports both
  `text` and `bytes` encodings with identical logical values, retains
  raw non-UTF-8 path and line bytes, merges same-line matches, sorts and
  merges overlapping/adjacent submatch ranges, resolves relative paths
  against the working directory without canonicalization, and orders
  files by unsigned byte ordering of raw path bytes. See
  [search-collection-path](search-collection-path.md).

## internal/app

- `internal/app/app.go` — Issue #3: the Bubble Tea model owning the
  search lifecycle. States: searching, summary, start-failed. `Init`
  returns a `collectResults` command that drains stdout and stderr
  concurrently, parses stdout into a `searchindex.Builder`, waits for
  ripgrep to exit, builds the index, and returns a `SearchCompleteMsg`.
  `Update` handles completion, failure, key (q, Ctrl-C, escape), and
  resize. `View` renders the searching and summary screens. See
  [search-collection-path](search-collection-path.md).

## Package boundaries awaiting their issues

Each is a documented empty package mirroring PRD Module Design:

- `internal/filebuffer` — per-file loading/classification into safe
  display-ready lines and validated highlights.
- `internal/viewport` — logical reading position and rendered-row
  visibility.
- `internal/theme` — active colour scheme and styles.
